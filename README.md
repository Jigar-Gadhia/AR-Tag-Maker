#Introduction

In this digital era, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and 
Extended Reality are growing rapidly. Anyone can experiance 
anyone of these technology with just a smartphone. 

Here, the major concern arrive that not every smartphone 
support AR, VR or XR. Now it’s time to introduce WebXR. 

WebXR is a Web Technology that is based on Extended Reality. 
Every smartphone support WebXR as it works in website so AR, 
VR or XR support for smartphone is not required. 

I am presenting a website called “AR tag maker”. With the help 
of this website, you can create any AR tag, print and stick to the 
desired place, then upload an image or video for which AR tag 
is meant to use and you are done
